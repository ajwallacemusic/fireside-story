      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>at STLCC in South County, mid September./p>
      <p>Git was acting up at first, but seems to be behaving better now, until...<p>
      <p>Anoushir forgot to create a firle inside lC101 directory.</p>
      <p>And AJ created the index.html file outside of the fireside-studio folder,<p>
    <p>so naturally Git was a bit confused.</p>
    <p>But they figured it out and started working on CSS, Branches, and Pull Requests, yay!<p>
